* # AIM:
    Predicting The Energy Output Of Wind Turbine Based On Weather Conditions Watson Auto AI
    
* # Project Description:
    Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the weather conditions present at its             site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid           costly overproduction. In this paper, we predict energy prediction based on weather data and analyse the important parameters as well as their correlation on the energy           output.
    ### Solution:
    Our aim is to map weather data to energy production. We wish to show that even data that is publicly available for weather stations close to wind farms can be used to give a       good prediction of the energy output. Furthermore, we examine the impact of different weather conditions on the energy output of wind farms. We are building an IBM Watson         AutoAI Machine Learning technique to predict the energy output of wind turbine. The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be used as API in mobile     app or web app building. We are developing a web application which is built using node red service. We make use of the scoring end point to give user input values to the           deployed model. The model prediction is then showcased on User Interface to predict the energy output of wind turbine
